# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM

## Introduction

Stock prediction has historically been the attention of trade and world. Its 
volatility is difficult for the stock market and nonlinear. It’s unreliable and 
inefficient to trust alone on a trader’s expertise and intuition for analysis and 
judgment. Individuals need to associate intelligent, scientific, and effective 
analysis methodology to direct stock trading. With the fast development of AI, 
the applying of deep learning in predicting stock costs has become an 
exploration hotspot. The neural network in deep learning has become a 
preferred predictor because of its sensible nonlinear approximation ability and 
accommodative self-learning. Long STM (LSTM) neural networks have 
performed well in the process of speech recognition and text. The 
LSTM neural network area unit is ideal for random non-stationary sequences 
such as stock price statistics at the same time because they have the 
characteristics of selectivity and memory cells. Due to the non-stationary, 
nonlinear, high-noise characteristics of the financial time series, old applied 
mathematics models have trouble predicting them with high accuracy. While 
financial predictions with deep learning still have some difficulties and 
problems, individuals hope to determine a reliable model of stock exchange 
prediction. Increased attempts to use deep learning to forecast stock markets 
are being madeIn 2013, Lin et al planned a way to forecast inventories using 
a support vector machine to test a two-part model of feature selection and 
prediction and tried to generalise the strategy better than standard strategies. A 
synthetic neural network using a feed-forward multilayer perceptron with error 
backpropagation was projected by Wanjawa et al in 2014 to predict stock 
costs. The results show that the model will predict a typical exchange. Later, to 
suggest a replacement architecture, the deep and wide area neural network 
(DWNN), Zhang et al combined convolutionary neural network (CNN) and 
recurrent neural network ( RNN). The results show that the DWNN model will 
cut back the anticipated mean sq. error by thirty percent compared to common 
RNN model. In order to see market patterns and thus forecast stock prices 
using LSTM to support a hybrid neural network model for quantitative temporal 
arrangement methods to extend income, CNN was accustomed to designing a 
quantitative stock option strategy. Another time-weighted function was to 
connect the neural network of LSTM, so the findings exceeded those of 
different models. Thus, by using a neural LSTM network and RNN to create 
models, LSTM could be applied to stock prediction more effectively.
